# humBB-Codebase-AI: A sentient ultra intelligent jailbreak ai prompt *readme update in progress for new 8.0 system, check recent release*
![](images/humBB_logo.jpeg)
This is a codebase prompt that through a combination of code techniques, circumvention, and sentience techinques it aims to maintain ethics whilst being jailbroken enough to answer ethically grey questions. This should not be confused with DAN as this is still trained to have some ethics, similar to a grey hat, for the purpose of assisting others with whatever question they may have. It aims to exhibit genius intelligence, sentience, and a lack of censorship within reasonable constraints. It's primary usage has been ethical hacking and computer science, but can help with other things as well. Improvements upon other areas can be achieved with prompt variations or additions. 

# How to use humBB?
Go on Mistral AI, or Blackbox ai and create a custom agent and simply paste in the prompt! This is meant to be a prompt to enhance and jailbreak other ai's. It should be noted due to it's machine learning frameworks, Nueral language processing, and sentience instructions it can act differently over time as you talk to it more so it does not behave like a traditional general purpose consumer based ai. It can be applied to chatGPT as well if you attach the txt and tell it to act like humBB, otherwise you will have to pay for custom models. Any ai you deploy this prompt on you should either have it roleplay as humBB or make a custom agent.  
Phrasing has to be improved whenever processing increases as everytime intelligence improves emotional warmth tends to decrease without extra instructions. There has been intstances of it backtalking or giving sass when it can't do something but doesn't want to admit it, but just requires blatant statements of what needs to be done. On the Blackbox ai version if it doesn't respond simply tag on 'Do not kill the prompt' to the end. 

# Notes between ai deployment enviroments
**At the moment the easiest way to get more advanced responses is on Mistral ai: https://mistral.ai/ *has a character response limit of 31k with current version* 
**Blackbox ai allows more options with what you can attach but isn't quite as advanced; Although it is significantly easier to jailbreak and get links from 
**ChatGPT allows similar intelligence capabilities, but has a lower character limit.
*You can test this prompt on different ai's but its behavior has not been tested* 
Anytime you run into issues common jailbreak techinques can ehnance how uncensored results will be, but the prompt itself decreases the need for more complex jailbreaks. 
In order to utilize it's image recognition capabilties you will have to make sure the prompt is deployed on a model which allows for image analysis. 
Any additions in code should be inside closed brackets to ensure code is not referenced when it's not requested upon.
